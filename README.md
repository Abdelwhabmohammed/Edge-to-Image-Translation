# Edge-to-Image-Translation

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d26c1d7a-beb5-4916-94fc-9f7fd10fa146)

This project demonstrates edge-to-image translation using a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN). The model is trained on paired data from the Edges2Shoes dataset, translating edge images into realistic shoe images. The approach leverages a U-Net-based generator and PatchGAN discriminator to capture detailed textures. The project explains the cGAN setup, architecture, training process, and evaluation, showcasing its ability to generate realistic images from sketches.
